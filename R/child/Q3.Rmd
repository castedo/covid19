### Q3: Does the CDC say I should wear a mask indoors in public?

<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">
  Guidance from the CDC (as of July 27 2021) for vaccinated people is</a>:
"wear a mask indoors in public if you are
**in an area of substantial or high transmission**."

The CDC uses two indicators to determine level of transmission:

1. weekly cases per population
2. percentage of positive diagnostic and screening nucleic acid amplification tests

More more than 500 new cases per week per million persons, is *substantial or high*
transmission per the CDC. For more details see
<a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view">CDC COVID Data Tracker</a>.
